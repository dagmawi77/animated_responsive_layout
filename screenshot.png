# Screenshot Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the application screenshot. 

To add a screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of your running application
2. Save it as `screenshot.png` in the project root
3. The README.md will automatically display it

The screenshot should show:
- The main application interface
- Both desktop and mobile views if possible
- Key features like the navigation rail, message list, and conversation view
